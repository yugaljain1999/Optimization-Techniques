# Optimization-Techniques
Gradient Descent
Hill Climbing

I have implemeneted some trustable optimization techniques which can perform good in optimization, currently I have apply this to find global maximum optimum value of function by minimizing the value of cost function and correspondingly update the parameters of function.
If anyone has other usecases that PR is welcomed.
